# A sample Guardfile
# More info at https://github.com/guard/guard#readme

## Uncomment and set this to only include directories you want to watch
# directories %w(app lib config test spec feature)

## Uncomment to clear the screen before every task
# clearing :on

## Make Guard exit when config is changed so it can be restarted
#
## Note: if you want Guard to automatically start up again, run guard in a
## shell loop, e.g.:
#
#  $ while bundle exec guard; do echo "Restarting Guard..."; done
#
## Note: if you are using the `directories` clause above and you are not
## watching the project directory ('.'), the you will want to move the Guardfile
## to a watched dir and symlink it back, e.g.
#
#  $ mkdir config
#  $ mv Guardfile config/
#  $ ln -s config/Guardfile .
#
# and, you'll have to watch "config/Guardfile" instead of "Guardfile"
#
watch ("Guardfile") do
  UI.info "Exiting because Guard must be restarted for changes to take effect"
  exit 0
end

# Note: The cmd option is now required due to the increasing number of ways
#       rspec may be run, below are examples of the most common uses.
#  * bundler: 'bundle exec rspec'
#  * bundler binstubs: 'bin/rspec'
#  * spring: 'bin/rspec' (This will use spring if running and you have
#                          installed the spring binstubs per the docs)
#  * zeus: 'zeus rspec' (requires the server to be started separately)
#  * 'just' rspec: 'rspec'
